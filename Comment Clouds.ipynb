PUGs that stagnate and start wiping a lot on a boss are on a timer of death. Eventually people will be leaving so rapidly that the lead cannot replace them and it\\'ll grind to a halt. Without some form of commitment any guild that doesn\\'t enforce a schedule will rapidly evolve into a revolving door of players which is exhausting for the leader and the players. \\n\\nYou also don\\'t really have a \"group of people I like to play with\". Without some commitment there\\'s not guarantee that you will regularly play with the same people ever. You also run into recruitment issues as you need such a large roster to be able to fill a raid at the drop of a hat, but then you will also have times where you have too many people and you will have to make decisions about who sits out. Then the issue of how to decide who sits without actually seeing most of them play often comes up.\\n\\nThe **TL;DR:** is that social dynamics of groups make it basically necessary to create schedules for challenging group content. It\\'s not really something you can design around and if the content becomes difficult enough you will always run into the same issues with freeform raiding.\\n\\nAs a someone who really wants to raid you\\'ll either have to accept that you probably won\\'t be raiding on the level that you\\'d like or figure out a way to fit it into your schedule. You don\\'t need to raid 15+ hours a week to have fun and progress and there are plenty of guilds out there if you are willing to do a bit of searching.\\n\\nIf you have a spouse/SO sit down with them and explain that this is something you really like doing (I feel like the best analogy is that it\\'s like a playing on a community sports team) and you\\'d like to dedicate X number of hours a week to it. It can be a little weird asking for this because the social stigma is that video games aren\\'t something you should be sitting down and playing on a schedule but if you let them know how you feel they *should* respect that and at least give it a shot. Make sure you respect the time you\\'ve committed though as you can get into big issues if you don\\'t.\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve had to do. My spouse still thinks it\\'s a little silly but she respects it and we have a open dialogue about it. Be honest with yourself about what you want to do, if you are like me and crave the intensity of well tuned boss fights and familiarity of a guild then you should figure out how to make it work.',\n",

It's never made sense that mobs are so cleanly separated by level/power. \\n\\nWhat's more is, since the burning legion is immortal and can send themselves back... Wouldn't they level too, as we kill them? Since we meet the legion armies in our own time streams, they really should become more powerful as we do. \\n\\nSo in this regard, I think the leveling system is both revolutionary and actually makes sense.

But they do have a lot of utility and are very flashy.  Overall a very sturdy tank, but IMO a simplistic version of a tank.\\n\\nDruid - New forms, heck yea.  High health so the ultimate meatshield.  Fun to play and overall very smooth rotation.  Lots of utility, but low Single target damage.  One of the best AoE tanks.\\n\\nMonk - Hard to say, their playstyle is different than most with the stagger mechanic.  Some will love it, others hate it.  They receive damage very smoothly and can mitigate some or take more depending on how you want to play.  Probably the class that someone can master and do very well on while others will be terrible.\\n\\nDK - Self healing for days.  Simple rotation, good HP, high AoE DPS tank.  Single target is a bit lacking, but very solid overall.  Low Mobility.\\n\\nDH - Well, they are the new kid on the block, super flashy, tons of mobility, lots of self healing... personally a bit of a frankenstein tank taking some of the best of the other tanks.
